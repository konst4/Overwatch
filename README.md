We implemented these usability heuristics:
Aesthetic and minimalist design : The main page is very cluttered with different functionalists that had to be implemented for the sake of requirements. This includes uploading files and logging in as a user.



Help and documentation: Currently there is no help and documentation. We will be implementing this page which will provide documentation  on how the web app should be used and if an error occurs.

Flexibility and efficiency use. Currently there is no way to go back to the main page without using the browser back functionality. This violates the heuristic of flexibility and efficiency of use. In order to fix this we will be implementing back functionality. 

Visibility of system status: Currently there is no system status to tell when a page is loading after a user is searched. Also there is not system status message to tell a user that the user they entered in search was not found. 











Old:
The first scenario is Search. Users can search there character profile and then receive information about there total wins. The users stats will come from a ajax call that hits the unofficial blizzard Overwatch API. The function then will display the information received from the API.

Patch notes the user can click the patch notes button and receive the latest patch notes. The latest patch notes will be displayed to the user. There will also be links to the official blizzard site containing the patch updates.

The Hoursplayed will be able to display the user the characters the user has played the most.
This displays the images using d3
