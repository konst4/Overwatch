# Overwatch
SWE432 project

Implemented:

The first scenario is Search. Users can search there character profile and then receive information about there total wins. The users stats will come from a ajax call that hits the unofficial blizzard Overwatch API. The function then will display the information received from the API.

Patch notes the user can click the patch notes button and receive the latest patch notes. The latest patch notes will be displayed to the user. There will also be links to the official blizzard site containing the patch updates.

Region select is now also implemented: once a region is selected; the url returned from the API will be of that respective region.
We implemented the d3 visualization for players hours played on the different characters in the game. The Api does not allow any data about leaderboards.
